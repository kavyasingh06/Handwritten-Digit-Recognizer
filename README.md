# Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer
Digit recognition system using CNN and the MNIST dataset. Built and trained a deep learning model for accurate image classification.
# ✍️ Handwritten Digit Recognizer using CNN (MNIST)

This project builds a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that classifies handwritten digits (0–9) from the **MNIST** dataset with high accuracy.

## 🧠 What I Did

- Preprocessed the MNIST digit dataset  
- Built a CNN with convolution, pooling, and dropout layers  
- Trained and evaluated the model  
- Made predictions on test samples  
- Visualized results (Predicted vs Actual)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repo or download the `.ipynb` notebook  
2. Open with Jupyter or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
3. Run all cells

> 📦 No need to upload dataset manually – `mnist` loads automatically from Keras
